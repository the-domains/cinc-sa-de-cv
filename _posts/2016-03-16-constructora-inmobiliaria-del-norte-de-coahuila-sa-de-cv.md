Constructora Inmobiliaria del Norte de Coahuila S.A. de C.V. (CINC) is an industrial real state developer of commercial plants ideal for IMMEX Maquiladoras, Manufacturing, Warehousing, and Distribution Centers.

Most of our operations are based in the north of Coahuila de Zaragoza, one of Mexico's most desirable locations for international businesses due to its close proximity to Texan focus cities such as Houston, San Antonio, and Austin; the fastest growing city of the United States.
